# API Ecommerce .NET 8

An API in .NET 8 with security through Identity and basic CRUD with secure access to endpoints depending on the role and having the active token. I will also create a frontend in Angular and another in React (still in development).

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Angular(Still developing, TODO: add repo link), TailwindCSS

**Backend:** .NET 8

**Database:**  MYSQL


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a full-stack developer with three years of experience in business apps. I have knowledge of Angular from version 12 to 19 (currently learning version 19) and .net up to version 8. I also know nodejs and react, but not at the same level, just the basics.

## Installation

Configure the database to which you will connect in the appsettings.json.

```bash
 dotnet ef migrations database update
```
